This large project is a response to the low levels of trust among members of society and a desire by the government to improve the behavior and law-following of all citizens. 

Right now the social credit system is being tested by many municipalities and companies -- the social credit system is slated for a nationwide roll-out in the near future. All citizens will receive a social credit identifier number and, via app technology, will be able to see their social credit score in real time as well as the reasons for having a high or low score.")

The government plans to track what videos and websites a user browses and what kind of purchases a user makes, including whether they do things such as buy too many video games or other purchases the government wants to discourage. Other things tracked may include users’ search history and WeChat postings.

Right now citizens have no way of knowing which government officials or companies have access to the social credit system data. Moreover, there are no regulations on how the system can be used to limit the freedoms of individual citizens - currently low social credit scores have prevented people from buying plane and train tickets and other, more severe punishments are being considered for those with low scores.")
