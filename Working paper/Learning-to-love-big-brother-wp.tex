\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The results of the survey strongly suggest that, despite all of the
invasive government monitoring used to attempt to control the spread of
Covid, respondents were generally supportive of government invasions of
their privacy. These findings cast doubt on the long-term impact of the
White Paper movement protests and connect to a larger body of literature
on why surveys of Chinese citizens indicate high levels of trust in
their government.

The data for this project was collected via a commercial survey firm in
two waves, February of 2021 and March of 2023. In both the first and
second waves, Wuhan was oversampled, with residents of the city set to
be 10\% of respondents. The 2021 survey had an n=1500 and the second had
an n=2000. Questions on the two surveys were identical other than a
minor change to a question that referenced a specific date. The timing
of the two surveys came at two very different points in time of China's
Covid-19 experience. The first survey was conducted approximately seven
months after the last round of restrictions were lifted on the city of
Wuhan. China, at the time, was essentially closed to foreign travel but
otherwise had little in the way of day to day public health
restrictions. Nationwide, daily Covid cases hovered around the single
digits (\emph{BBC News}, 2021). China was at a very different point in
its journey in March of 2023. The year of 2022 saw widespread, intrusive
digital monitoring introduced. Many major cities, such as Shanghai,
Xi'an, and Shenzhen, underwent long and painful city-wide lockdown
procedures. At the end of 2023, under the weight of a spiraling number
of cases and widespread protests (termed the White Paper Revolution),
China finally abandoned its zero Covid policy (Mao, 2022). The two waves
of these surveys aim to compare attitudes before and after this
widespread and highly visible change in digital monitoring strategies.

The demographics of the 2021 and 2023 surveys are presented in
Table~\ref{tbl-demographics}.

\hypertarget{tbl-demographics}{}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

As is typical of online surveys in China, the sample respondents skew
somewhat younger and more educated. Comparing the two waves, there are
some modest demographic differences (notably education and marriage)
differences between the two samples. As will be shown in
Section~\ref{sec-analysis}, these minor differences do not appear to
change any of the substantive results. Focusing on the 2023 survey, the
modal respondent is someone from a small city, male, married, working in
a white collar job at a small enterprise, who earns about 10,000 RMB a
month and has an urban \emph{hukou}. This demographic profile already
suggests that while the large-scale lockdowns that occurred in a few of
the big cities generated a lot of press, they may not be the modal or
average citizen's experience with zero Covid policies.

Taking a wide-angle view on the government's performance,
Table~\ref{tbl-gp.summary.data} compares some different measures of
government performance. While the higher level of government trust in
the central government is unsurprising (consistent with previous
literature, see CITATION), the magnitude of the gap is somewhat smaller
than in previous studies. There has been a small but statistically
significant decrease in trust of both since 2021. Most interestingly,
though, is that there was no decrease in how residents feel the
government handled their privacy information. This seems to indicate
that it not necessarily government monitoring that made residents
unhappy but instead other zero Covid policy failures.

Turning to the issue of specific attitudes regarding monitoring,
Table~\ref{tbl-gm.summary.data} suggests that while the differences are
not large, respondents in the second wave were more accepting of almost
all forms of monitoring. Given the phrasing of the question - ``there
are good reasons for the government to monitor you'', it seems likely
that respondents were accepting the government's framing that such
digital monitoring and control was a necessary part of the pandemic
response. Not surprisingly, and consistent with previous research (Chen,
2017; Chen and MacDonald, 2020; Li, 2016), respondents trust the
government at significantly higher levels than private corporations.
While the pandemic-era monitoring was in fact a public-private
partnership\footnote{Alibaba and Tencent served as the interface for the
  health code system while the data was analyzed and manipulated by
  local governments (McMorrow and Leng, 2022).}, respondents seem to
have a very clear delineation of which parties may acceptably gather
their data and which should not.

This result is one of the largest differences between 2021 and 2023
among all survey questions. In 2023, respondents felt that the central
government had a significantly stronger reason to monitor them compared
to 2021. Respondents also agreed that the local government had a better
case to monitor them compared to 2021, though the magnitude of the
change was not as dramatic. Other types of monitoring (private
monitoring, biometric monitoring) also exhibited a statistically
significant change in the direction of being more accepting of tracking.
The most direct interpretation of this response pattern is that
respondents fundamentally accepted the government's position that
monitoring was necessary and justified during the pandemic. Contrary to
the Western popular press reports of the White Paper Revolution, it does
not seem that most Chinese citizens were unhappy about Covid electronic
controls. The slight decrease in government trust could indicate
dissatisfaction with other Covid policies (including forced
quarantines), but it does not seem that app-based monitoring itsellf
caused any great concern among the general public.

One possible reason why respondents may believe that private
corporations are less trustworthy could arise from feeling that their
monitoring is more invasive. However, this turns out not to be the case
- respondents feel that all three entities are roughly equally likely to
monitor them. A likely interpretation of this result is that respondents
are unable to precisely identify who is monitoring them and when. When
the question about privacy is rephrased to further emphasize that these
different groups could access their private information, trust with
government sources decreases modestly compared to the previous phrasing
in Table~\ref{tbl-gm.q.text}. However, this decrease is matched by a
similar decrease in comfort with private companies monitoring them.
These results reinforce the results in Table~\ref{tbl-gm.summary.data}
and further strengthen the finding of

What may explain the lack of increased concern about digital privacy is
that respondents generally did not notice a major change in the level of
online monitoring. While the increase was statistically significant, it
was just barely at the edge of significance and amounts to less than
1/10th a standard deviation increase in perceived monitoring. Given the
invasiveness of the technological means of control employed to control
Covid, this result is surprising. Two reasonable explanations for this
divergence are 1) respondents do not consider the Covid controls to be
online monitoring and/or, in my view, more likely, 2) respondents have
already readjusted their frame of reference and no longer bring to mind
the Covid-19 era when answering this question. While the survey results
cannot arbitrate between these two explanations, both of these
explanations suggest that even a massive and intrusive increase in
surveillance has shifted attitudes about monitoring overall. If the
first explanation is true, it suggests that the kinds of monitoring that
Chinese citizens are worried about are drastically different than the
kinds Western privacy advocates are concerned about. If a government is
monitoring your every move and such activity is not considered to be
tracking your activity, then it suggests a very different set of ideas
about what is a concerning type of monitoring. If the second explanation
is true, it does suggest that respondents that view somewhat
time-limited surveillance and surveillance for a specific purpose as
being acceptable. One can easily imagine, however, such tools being used
again for periodic incidents of unrest and these results suggest that
respondents may view controls, as long as viewed as `necessary' may be
seen as acceptable at least after the fact.

Rounding out the final section of the regular survey questions are a set
of questions designed to further parse attitudes about online
monitoring, the results of which are shown in
Table~\ref{tbl-misc.summary.data}. The results of these questions
generally confirm and support the findings of all the previous question
blocks. As with most of the survey questions, there appeared to be only
a very modest change in response patterns between 2021 and 2023.
Respondents generally agree that they do not notice government tracking.
They strongly agree that the government protects their data better than
private corporations. They strongly disagree that they are willing to
give up their privacy simply to use apps for free. Finally, many
respondents feel worried about having their payment data stolen. In most
cases, it is unwise to place too much emphasis on any one question,
given respondents can misinterpret or gloss over any specific question.
In this survey, however, respondents have repeatedly indicated that they
trust the government at significantly higher rates than private
corporations and that most of users worries about being online are
related to protection of their information from corporations.

One obvious objection to the finding that respondents have a higher
degree of concern with private monitoring compared to government
monitoring is that respondents are engaging in preference falsification
- they may be worried about, either consciously or subconsciously,
marking the government negatively in a survey. To address this concern,
the end of the survey employed a list experiment to measure variation in
levels of trust. The list experiment question gives respondents a list
of organizations that they may trust and then asks them to report the
number of organizations that they trust. Half of the respondents were
given a list of organizations that included a sensitive organization
(such as the central government). The other half was given a list
without the sensitive organization included. The idea is that
respondents may be more comfortable reporting that they do not trust an
organization when they do not have to consciously mark on a survey that
they do not trust it but instead is part of a mental math calculation
along with other items (Blair and Imai, 2012). List experiments have
been used across many fields to study sensitive topics such as racism,
abortion, and sexual violence (Moseson et al., 2017; Redlawsk et al.,
2010; Traunmüller et al., 2019). Since trust in corporations does not
seem likely to generate preference falsification problems, they were not
included as a separate list experiment. However, the contents of the
list items are largely technology companies so some inference can be
drawn about trust in technology companies versus the government.

The results of the list experiment are shown in
Table~\ref{tbl-listexp.summary.data}. For respondents shown the
sensitive list item, one can estimate that about 60\% of people selected
it (given that the baseline level is about 0.6 number of items selected
lower than compared to when respondents are shown the sensitive list
item). While it is hard to directly compare with the Likert-scaled
questions, note that the average on the Likert scale questions for
various trust measure of government use of data was about 4.5 out of 7,
or roughly the 65th percentile of the scale. By way of contrast, 3 out
of the 4 list items were private technology firms and the other list
item was their family. Considering private corporations, if one
speculatively assumes is that most people will select the trust in their
family list item, roughly indicating that a little over 1 out of 3 of
the private corporations on the list were mentally chosen. This roughly
accords with the average responses to trust in private corporations of
2.5 out of 7 on a Likert scale. These results are not meant to
definitively confirm that there are no issues of preference
falsification. That being said, the results do strongly parallel to the
directly asked questions, adding confidence to the interpretation of the
results of the previous tables.

\subsection{Additional Analysis}\label{sec-analysis}}

In order to help rule out the possibility that some of the differences
observed between 2021 and 2023 in the government trust and
comfortability of being monitored are driven simply by demographi
changes, Table~\ref{tbl-basicreg} reports on the results of a simple
regression framework. The response variables are: 1) trust in the
central government, 2) trust in the local government, 3) comfort with
central government monitoring, 4) comfort with local government
monitoring, and 5) comfort with private company monitoring. Included in
the regression are a standard suite of demographic variables and the
year variable.

The year variable magnitude matches almost exactly the simple difference
in means observed in Section~\ref{sec-datasummary}. This result is
unsurprising given the very modest difference in demographics between
the two waves of the survey. It may be the case that other factors
besides the Covid situation precipitated the observed difference in
means though it is hard to imagine any event or trend that had a
stronger impact than the 2022 lockdowns. In terms of interesting
coefficients, age is consistenly positively related to acceptance of
government monitoring and negatively related to private corporation
monitoring. This finding may partially explain events like the White
Paper Revolution, which was primarily a protest of the young. However,
the magnitude of coefficient is not very impactful - changing a
respondent's age from 20 to 70 changes the predicted response to the
acceptance of monitoring questions by 0.5 points - less than the size of
the year coefficient (0.6). Not being a party member also decreased
acceptance of monitoring by about 0.2 points. Income is sometimes a
relevant predictor though inconsistently so. Overall, the regressions
have a very low R2, indicating that most of the variation in individual
responses is due to factors outside of demographic variables. So while
suggestive, the demographic variables have only limited substantive
relationship to variation in attitudes on these questions.

Turning toward differences between government and private protection of
privacy, Table~\ref{tbl-trackingreg} presents regression results for
tracking questions on the same suite of demographic controls. In
particular, these regressions consider the question of ``how closely do
you think \emph{x} tracks your online activity?'' (regressions 1-3) and
``How comfortable are you with \emph{x} knowing personal details about
your activity online?'' (regressions 4-6). Again, it should be repeated
that the R2 for all regressions are also very low - most variation in
question response is not accounted for in the model. However, there are
a few interesting observations to make. First is that those in larger
cities are more likely to notice monitoring as compared to those living
small cities, even controlling for income and education. The magnitude
of the coefficient is not large (0.3 for those living in big cities) but
does suggest that urban surveillance does not go unnoticed. While the
year coefficient is signficant in some instances, the magnitude is very
small (0.1) indicating a substantively insignificant effect.
Interestingly, not being a party member is assocated both with less
noticing of monitrong and less comfort with organizations knowing their
private details. Again, the coefficients are relatively small but does
suggest that having some level of knowledge of what kind of surveilance
is associated with more positive views of its use. Some of the other
demographic variables are occasionally significant but not in a way that
indicates a consistent and meaningful relationship with the response
variables.

Finally, a look at the subset of the data for those living in Xi'an,
Shanghai, and Wuhan. Both Shanghai and Xi'an suffered painful lockdowns
in December of 2021 and April 2022, respectively. Wuhan was the original
source of the Covid outbreak and underwent a many months long set of
lockdwns and restrictions in 2021. The results for key questions broken
down by city can be found in Table~\ref{tbl-gp.detailed.data}. The set
of questions relating to overall trust and whether respondents see good
reasons to allow each entity to collect their data (part (a)) suggests
that the only city that is significantly different from the overall
pattern of cities is Shanghai, but in ways that one might expect.
Shanghainese trust their local government more than cities overall (the
Shanghai coefficient on LG Trust). This is not a surprising result given
that Shanghai has long been seen as one of the most technocratic and
sophisticated local governments (citation). However, the results also
seem to indicate that Shanghai residents saw a very substantively large
decrease in trust in their local governments (the Shanghai x 2023
coefficient on CG Trust and LG Trust). Furthermore Shanghai residents
also had a major decrease in agreement that the government has a good
reason to monitor them in 2023 (the Shanghai x 2023 coefficient on CG
Monitor and LG monitor). The size of the coefficient on all of these is
also substantively very large. None of the other cities seem
significantly different from the average of other cities or locations.

These results make sense given the severity of the Shanghai lockdown and
the post-lockdown strict controls. For many residents, the lockdown was
highly traumatic but without a sense of shared unity or purpose, as was
the case in the 2020 Wuhan lockdown. Furthermore, the Shaghainese local
government, long considered one of the most capable city governments in
China, seriously mishandled the logistics of the lockdown, leaving many
people scrambling for food and medicine. However, the results presented
in part (b) complicate this story somewhat. Shanghai does not appear to
be any different than other cities while respondents from Wuhan
consistently are more likely to notice tracking efforts. I have no stong
hypothesis as to the Wuhan results but the Shanghai findings may be
suggestive that respondents are reading this set of questions as
referring to the present rather than including the pandemic time period.
