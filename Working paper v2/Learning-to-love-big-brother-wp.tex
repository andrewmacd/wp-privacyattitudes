\title{(No) Privacy Please!: What Determines Chinese Attitudes Toward
Online Government Monitoring}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This study investigates what are the determinants of public opinion
toward government monitoring in China. Existing literature on acceptance
of government monitoring has several open questions, including to what
extent demographic variables influence the relationship, how government
trust is related to acceptance of government monitoring, and whether
acceptance of public vs.~private monitoring has the same determinants.
Using a two-wave survey of before and after the Covid-19 lockdowns in
China, this survey finds that: 1) demographic factors do not appear to
be related to acceptance of government monitoring; 2) government trust
does predict attitudes, but the Covid-19 experience significantly
modified this relationship, and 3) private monitoring acceptance does
appear to have different determinants. The study concludes with
consideration of some implications of these findings.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec-introduction}

The dramatic events of the Covid-19 era brought to the foreground
citizens' relationship toward government tracking technologies. Users
were often required to install apps that monitored their location,
stores they entered, and even whether or not they purchased cold
medicines (McMorrow and Leng, 2022). Nowhere was this tracking more
invasive than in China, a place in which the government mobilized
technological tools to deeply peer into the daily lives of its citizens.
The impact of these events on users' attitudes toward technological
monitoring has still not been fully described. Using a unique dataset,
this study resolves several open questions in the literature regarding
how citizens view government monitoring.

Citizen attitudes toward government intrusions on their online privacy
is an understudied area with a number of open questions in the
literature (GÃ³mez-Barroso, 2018), particularly as how citizens view this
topic in authoritarian and non-Western contexts. One open question is
the extent to which demographic or privacy knowledge variables predict
attitudes. Literature on generalized privacy have a number of
suggestions as to which variables may be important in shaping attitudes,
but little has been done to see if these findings apply to attitudes
towards government monitoring. To the extent there is an agreement in
the literature, it is that government trust should be strongly related
government tracking attitudes, but this literature has not come to an
agreement about how an event like Covid-19 lockdowns alter the
relationship or provided direct causal tests of the relationship.
Finally, the literature is not clear as to whether the variables that
predict government tracking attitudes should also predict private
tracking or not.

To resolve these gaps in the literature, this study utilizes two waves
of a survey conducted before and after the 2022 Covid-19 lockdowns in
China to develop models of respondent attitudes. The first model
examines a set of demographic and technology knowledge variables as
predictors for government tracking acceptance and finds the models to be
poor fits and few variables obtain statistical or substantive
significance. The second set of models adds government trust as a
predictor variable and finds, as expected, that government trust is an
important predictor of attitudes. Next, a mediation model is developed
that separates the direct effect of Covid-19 on government tracking
attitudes from the indirect effect of Covid-19 influencing government
trust, which then flows through to impacting attitudes on government
monitoring. The mediation model finds that the overall effect of
Covid-19 is positive but complex, with the direct and indirect effects
operating in different directions. Finally, a model that tests whether
any of the predictor variables for public tracking can predict attitudes
toward private tracking; the model results suggest that they cannot.

Taken together, these results suggest that government trust matters but
what may be equally important is the public perception of the rationale
for government tracking, and that these two factors have an independent
impact on attitudes. The conclusion discusses these results with respect
to the literature and draws out some important implications and areas
for future research.

\section{Literature review}\label{sec-litreview}

\subsection{Background}\label{background}

What predicts respondent attitudes toward government tracking of their
online activity has generated significant scholarly interest in the last
ten years, yet the findings have not reached any firm conclusions on a
number of important questions (Reddick et al., 2015). Compounding this
problem, to date, most of the research on the topic has been conducted
primarily on U.S. or Western respondents, with comparatively fewer
researchers reporting on developing or non-democratic countries. This
research agenda has taken on new urgency during the Covid-19 pandemic,
as governments around the globe engaged in highly intrusive monitoring
and data collection activities.

From the pre-Covid privacy literature, two important findings stand out.
The first is that demographic variables are important predictors of
attitudes toward generalized online privacy. In an important early study
of early Internet users, Sheehan has found that education and age are
two important determinants of online privacy attitudes (Sheehan, 2002).
Others have replicated this result and found that characteristics such
as gender, social setting, and income also play a role in forming
privacy expectations (Anwar et al., 2017; BÃ¼chi et al., 2021; Lee et
al., 2019). The second finding is that respondent personal experience
with privacy and technology is also an important factor in predicting
privacy attitudes. Baskaran and Mathew find that users who have
significant knowledge and interest in privacy have a greater fear of
losing their privacy and this fear motivates them to change their online
behavior (Baskaran and Mathew, 2024). Dupree et al.~suggest that there
are several possible types of online user typologies, with user
experience being a variable that matters but can potentially shift
respondents to an extreme view in either direction (Dupree et al.,
2016). Kokolakis, as part of a meta-analysis of privacy, notes that
young people may be more conscious of their online privacy context and
therefore are more active in policing their privacy boundaries
(Kokolakis, 2017), a result replicated by Blank et al.(Blank et al.,
n.d.). These findings all suggest that personal characteristics and
background are important determinants of privacy attitudes, though it is
not clear how these findings relate to government monitoring
specifically.

The second key finding is that trust in the state is an important
correlate to whether respondents feel anxious about government
monitoring of their online behavior. Davis and Silver find that
Americans who have lower levels of trust in the government were less
willing to accept government surveillance programs after the 9/11
terrorist attacks (Davis and Silver, 2004). Pavone and Esposti found
that users either trusted the government and therefore did not find
proposed monitoring concerning, or did not trust the government and
therefore believed any monitoring to be threatening (Pavone and Esposti,
2012). TrÃ¼dinger and Steckermeier find that acceptance of government
surveillance in Germany depends on how much respondents trust the state
(TrÃ¼dinger and Steckermeier, 2017). However, this literature has, so
far, not been able to causally link the two concepts. It is possible
that acceptance of government monitoring is downstream of government
trust, but it could also be the case that government trust and
monitoring are both the result of personality or demographic attributes.
It is also unclear from these studies how rapidly or what types of
events might change government trust and then whether that change in
trust would then alter attitudes for acceptance of government tracking.

The literature on government monitoring of citizens increased
dramatically after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, though most of
the findings echo those of Pavone and Esposti and other earlier
scholars. Because the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in a wide range of new
tracking technologies, scholars have focused directly on how users and
respondents felt regarding government monitoring (for a sampling of the
vast literature, see (Abramova et al., 2022; Garrett et al., 2021;
Ioannou and Tussyadiah, 2021; Ong and Loo, n.d.; Wnuk et al., 2020)). To
highlight one example of this Covid-era research, Ioannou and Tussyadiah
highlights the linkage between state trust, surveillance acceptance, and
perceived necessity in explaining the variation in willingness to use
contact tracing apps in the U.S. Generally this research finds Covid-19
is an important factor in shaping views of tracking. However, most of
this research tests acceptance of specific monitoring technologies (such
as vaccine passports) or examine attitudes only in close temporal
proximity to the technology use and therefore offer limited information
about the durability of these attitudes.

How these findings translate to the Chinese context is not clear. While
recent research has begun to develop a picture of Chinese attitudes
toward government monitoring, there are still some important unanswered
questions. Several studies have found that Chinese respondents are
generally more willing to use or accept government surveillance
technologies across several different technology types
(Habich-Sobiegalla and Kostka, 2023; Kostka et al., 2021; Kostka and
Habich-Sobiegalla, 2024). Liu and Kostka, in separate papers, both find
that trust in the state is correlated with increased acceptance of the
social credit system (Liu) and surveillance more broadly (Kostka)
(Kostka, 2023; Liu, 2022). To date, there have not been any major
studies that have conducted a before and after anaylsis of attitude
change as a result of China's Covid-19 experience.

Finally, there is also a line of research into whether there are
differences in attitudes if the surveillance is government versus
privately conducted. Steinfeld finds that there are differences in
attitudes between the two, with acceptance of the justification for
surveillance being key for government monitoring (accepting the War on
Terror as essential) versus compensatory benefits being the strongest
predictor of private monitoring acceptance (Steinfeld, 2017). Nam finds
that it is primarily demographic features that predict generalized
privacy concerns, while government privacy concerns are primarily
predicted by government trust (Nam, 2019). Research in China by
Steinhardt et al.~find that users in China tend to trust the government
with their data more than they do with private corporations but does not
consider the specific determinants of this variation in trust
(Steinhardt et al., 2022). The two existing studies that show
differential attitudes have not been replicated in non-Western contexts
and also focus on specific privacy topics rather than asking about
privacy in a more generalized sense.

\subsection{Contribution}\label{contribution}

This work aims to make three contributions to the literature on
government surveillance. First, it seeks to help clarify which
demographic and attitudinal factors are important in predicting privacy
concerns. Previous findings of support for respondent attributes that
predict acceptance of government surveillance do not find support here
may suggest features of the Chinese context that lead to this variation
in results. This variation may also apply to other non-democratic or
non-Western countries.

Second, this study aims to establish whether there is a causal linkage
between government trust and goverment privacy attitudes. There have
been very few studies of privacy atttitudes that are not purely
cross-sectional. The survey used in this paper was conducted in two
waves, before the strict Covid controls were enacted in China, and
another wave conducted just after the controls were relaxed. During this
time, as You et al.~have found, the Chinese response to the pandemic
engendered significant criticism and resulted in a decline in trust of
government (You et al., 2024). This study can help understand if these
events, and the intense government monitoring that was used to control
the pandemic, lead to any significant changes in the relationship
between state trust and acceptance of government surveillance.

Finally, it aims to assess whether there are different determinants of
tracking acceptance depending on if tracking is conducted by private
rather than government organizations. If there are different
determinants, it would suggest that users are aware of the political
context of government monitoring and that this awareness shapes their
attitudes. This clarification is important given that much of the
existing research on privacy attitude formation focuses on private
monitoring (GÃ³mez-Barroso, 2018).

\subsection{Hypotheses}\label{hypotheses}

The existing literature and the specific features of this survey
generates a set of testable hypotheses, including:

\(H_1\): Demographic variables such as age, education, and income
predict acceptance of government monitoring

A finding here that certain demographic factors are predictors of
attitudes toward government monitoring can help clarify whether the
demographic linkages found in research on generalized privacy attitudes
or attitudes toward private monitoring are similar for attitudes toward
government monitoring.

\(H_{2a}\) Technical know-how and privacy consciousness predicts
acceptance of government monitoring

\(H_{2b}\): Technical know-how and privacy consciousness does not
predict acceptance of government monitoring

Existing literature finds that those with significant experience or
knowledge of information and communication technologies (ICTs) are more
careful with their online privacy. However, it is also the caset that he
Chinese online information environment is highly controlled,
particularly with respect to any information critical of the government
(Han, 2018) so such knowledge may have less of an impact on attitudes.
Government propaganda extolling the benevolence of the state with
regards to ICT policy (Gainous et al., 2023) may even counteract or
reverse the fear effect of greater knowledge. Therefore, privacy
knowledge and technical skill may also be uncorrelated or positively
correlated with support for government monitoring.

\(H_3\): Trust in government should predict acceptance of government
monitoring

Both existing studies of Chinese users and those outside of China have
all found this relationship to be a relatively robust one. Research on
China has also found that government trust is an important predictor of
many other social and attitudinal variables (Chen, 2017; Qiu et al.,
2012; Zhou and Jin, 2018).

\(H_4\): The pandemic should alter the acceptance of government
monitoring

This hypothesis could be true in two different ways. The first way is
via a direct effect - the experience of intrusive and long-lasting
surveillance could lower support for government monitoring. The second
way is via an indirect effect - the experience of the pandemic could
decrease government trust and then this decrease in trust leads to lower
support for government surveillance.

\(H_5\): Factors that drive concern regarding government tracking should
differ from concerns regarding private tracking

Given that previous research has found significant differences in the
level of acceptance of tracking between public and private sources in
China, and, that trust in government is likely not a factor for
accepting private tracking, there should be differences in the factors
that predict these two variables.

\section{Data and summary statistics}\label{sec-datasummary}

The data for this project was collected via a commercial market research
firm in two waves, February of 2021 and March of 2023. The 2021 survey
had an n=1500 and the second had an n=2000. Questions on the two surveys
were identical other than a minor change to a question that referenced a
specific date. The timing of the two surveys came at two very different
points in time of China's Covid-19 experience. The first survey was
conducted approximately seven months after the last round of
restrictions were lifted on the city of Wuhan. China, at the time, was
essentially closed to foreign travel but otherwise had little in the way
of day to day public health restrictions. Nationwide, daily Covid cases
hovered around the single digits (\emph{BBC News}, 2021). China was at a
very different point in its journey in March of 2023. The year of 2022
saw widespread, intrusive digital monitoring introduced. Many major
cities, such as Shanghai, Xi'an, and Shenzhen, underwent long and
painful city-wide lockdown procedures. At the end of 2022, under the
weight of a spiraling number of cases and widespread protests (termed
the White Paper Revolution), China finally abandoned its zero Covid
policy (Mao, 2022). February 2021 is therefore at a point of Covid-19
awareness but of relatively mild restrictions on residents freedoms.
March 2023 is far enough from the end of the zero Covid policies that
any temporary effects of the lockdowns and monitoring should have faded
but close enough to the end that differences in attitudes can plausibly
be attributed to the Covid-19 experience. These two surveys therefore
serve as excellent evidence to examine hypotheses 1-5.\footnote{All code
  and data to replicate these results available at the author's GitHub
  repository.}

The demographics of the 2021 and 2023 surveys are presented in
Table~\ref{tbl-demographics}.

\bottomrule

\end{longtable}

As is typical of online surveys in China, the sample respondents skew
somewhat younger and more educated. Comparing the two waves, there are
some modest demographic differences (notably education and marriage)
between the two samples. As will be shown in Section~\ref{sec-analysis},
these minor differences do not appear to change any of the substantive
results. Focusing on the 2023 survey, the modal respondent is someone
from a small city, male, married, working in a white collar job at a
small enterprise, who earns about 10,000 RMB a month and has an urban
residence permit (\emph{hukou}).

To simplify the analysis that follows, the variables are recoded such
that income is divided into three categories (low, middle, and high) and
education is divided into two categories, those with college education
and those without. The regressions in the following sections were tested
with alternate specifications of these categorical variables (code for
these regressions available at the author's website) and the key results
were unaffected.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tbl-respvarindex}Questions asking about attitudes toward
government monitoring}

\begin{tabular}[t]{l|>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{5in}}
\hline
GM1 & There are good reasons for the central government to monitor the activity of users online\\
\hline

\hline
\cellcolor{gray!6}{TRACK2} & \cellcolor{gray!6}{How comfortable are you with the local government knowing personal details about your activity online?}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

}

\end{table}%

The key response variable for the following analysis is an index
variable created by combining the results of the four questions in
Table~\ref{tbl-respvarindex}, rescaled to be between zero and one. It is
true that previous research has found that Chinese respondents place
lower levels of trust in local governments as compared to central
governments (Chen, 2017; Zhong, 2014). However, the correlation between
\texttt{GM1} and \texttt{GM2} is 0.84 and the correlation between
\texttt{TRACK1} and \texttt{TRACK2} is 0.87. Additionally, as shown in
the online appendices, each of the major regression results in
Section~\ref{sec-analysis} do not demonstrate major changes if the same
variables are regressed on each of the survey question items
individually. Indicating their close relationship, the variables taken
together have a Cronbach's \(\alpha\) of 0.81. Intuitively, this high
level of relatedness makes sense as while respondents have some
background attitudes about the difference between central and local
governments, they may not easily be able to identify at which level
government tracking occurs.

Finally, there has been some debate as to the extent of preference
falsification of political attitudes on online surveys in China (Carter
et al., 2024; Jiang and Yang, 2016; Ratigan and Rabin, 2020). If the
respondents are afraid of revealing their true attitudes toward the
government, it may potentially bias the results. To test for preference
falsification, the survey instrument also contained several list
experiment questions in which respondents did not have to directly
reveal their preferences but instead their attitudes can be inferred
indirectly. List experiments have been used in a number of surveys to
allow residents a confidential method to express their true attitudes
about topics such as racial views, sexual assault experience, and
political views (Moseson et al., 2017; Redlawsk et al., 2010). While
Glynn (2013) points out that list experiments should not be seen as
silver bullet to the problem of preference falsification, the results of
the list experiments (available in the online appendices) roughly match
the answers to the component questions that comprise the response
variable index. Additionally, the topic of the survey is less sensitive
than other, directly political, research and should therefore be less
likely to engender significant fear of punishment from respondents.

Overall, the survey data should provide a robust test to arbitrate
between the hypotheses posed in Section~\ref{sec-litreview}.

\section{Analysis}\label{sec-analysis}

\subsection{Predicting citizen attitudes about government
monitoring}\label{predicting-citizen-attitudes-about-government-monitoring}

The first set of models considers the question of which demographic
variables predict variation in attitudes toward being tracked by the
government. Overall, the central finding is that the demographic
variables are relatively weak predictors of acceptance of government
monitoring. The key predictor variables included in
Table~\ref{tbl-citizenatt} are the standard suite of demographic
variables, the tech savvy index (TSI), and the knowledge index (KI). The
items used to construct the two indicies variables are listed in
Section~\ref{sec-appendix}. The Cronbach's \(\alpha\) for each of the
two variables are 0.8 and 0.55 respectively, indicating that the
questions are suitable for use in an index.

\end{table}%

The coefficients generally indicate effects in the direction expected.
Older respondents are more accepting of government tracking, while being
male and not being a member of the party predict lower acceptance of
tracking. Curiously, living in a big city has a positive relationship
with tracking acceptance, as does the year 2023. Being tech savvy is
positively related to acceptance of tracking, while having knowledge of
privacy is negatively associated with the response variable.

However, with respect to the magnitude of the coefficients, the response
variable is scaled between zero and one with a standard deviation of
0.2. Given this scaling, the coefficients of the categorical variables
all have rather small effect sizes - being in year 2023 instead of year
2021 produces a shift in the response variable of about a third of a
standard deviation. For the other categorical variables, while some
reach significance, they have even smaller effect sizes. The tech savvy
index has a standard deviation of 0.21. The coefficient of \texttt{TSI}
indicates the impact of a one unit change in the index (going from its
minimum to its maximum) on the response variable. However, a more
typical shift in \texttt{TSI} produces an effect only one fifth as
large, or about a fifth to a tenth of a standard deviation change in the
response variable. Similarly, for \texttt{KI}, a typical shift in the
predictor variable leads to a nearly negligible change in the response
variable.

As can be inferred from the results in this table, the model fit is
relatively poor. The poor model fit can also be seen in the very low
\(R^2\) values and in the extremely poor model residuals (available in
the online appendices). Taken together, these results indicate that the
available demographic factors do a poor job explaining variation in
attitudes towards government tracking, suggesting that the Chinese
context may have other factors that are more important and relevant to
predicting support for government tracking.

\subsection{Does government trust affect
attitudes?}\label{does-government-trust-affect-attitudes}

Another plausible relationship is that generalized trust in government
is a strong predictor of attitudes toward government monitoring. Similar
to the key variables in the preceding section, the measure of both local
government and central government performance are combined into an index
(\texttt{GPI}). As noted in Section~\ref{sec-datasummary}, while there
has been an observed gap in measurement of the two concepts in previous
literature (and in these surveys), the responses to the two questions
are nevertheless highly correlated (\(\rho=0.73\)). To the extent that
they measure disjoint opinions, models \texttt{1b} and \texttt{1c} take
central government performance alone and local government performance
alone, as the response variables.

\end{table}%

The coefficients on in Table~\ref{tbl-governmentatt} indicate that
government performance is a much stronger predictor of attitudes towards
government tracking than the index demographic variables. In model
\texttt{1}, a one standard deviation increase in the government
performance index (0.2) predicts about a one third of a standard
deviation change in attitudes towards government tracking, a relatively
significant effect for an attitudinal survey. Additionally, the two
interaction terms are also both significant. The effect of these
interaction terms can be viewed in Figure~\ref{fig-marginplotperform}.
Education lessens the impact of government performance on acceptance of
government tracking while year 2023 increases the impact. Finally, the
model fit diagnostics have improved, indicating a better model fit.

As expected, government performance, controlling for demographic
factors, is a relatively strong predictor of acceptance of government
performance. According to the model, a positive view of government
performance is associated with an increased acceptance of government
monitoring. However, the relationship is likely more complex than a
simple direct causation model, particularly given the tumultuous events
of the 2022 Covid-19 lockdowns in China. To further explore how these
factors interact with each other, the next section develops a mediation
model to better understand how this relationship may have changed due to
the events of 2022.

\subsection{Changing attitudes since the
pandemic}\label{changing-attitudes-since-the-pandemic}

The following directed acyclic graph (DAG) indicates the hypothesized
causal process that generates the observed outcome variable, tracking
acceptance. In Figure~\ref{fig-dag}, \texttt{TA} represents tracking
acceptance, \texttt{GP} represents government performance approval,
\texttt{DEMO} represents demographic characteristics, and \texttt{COVID}
represents respondents' Covid-19 experience.

\begin{figure}

\centering{

\includegraphics{Learning-to-love-big-brother-wp_files/figure-pdf/fig-dag-1.pdf}

}

\caption{\label{fig-dag}Causal process}

\end{figure}%

To operationalize this model, the first step is to create a latent
demographics construct with the demographic variables previously used in
regressions in the earlier sections loading onto this construct.
\texttt{COVID} is operationalized by the \texttt{year} variable.
Admittedly, this is not a precise operationalization of the Covid
experience - the \texttt{year} variable actually measures all changes
between survey waves not accounted for by other variables. With respect
to government tracking acceptance attitudes, however, this assumption
can be justified by the fact that the Covid-19 experience was both a
daily and often traumatic one for the Chinese public; it was a time
period that involved constant and invasive technological monitoring. If
the model does indicate that the \texttt{year} variable predicts
significant change in the response variable over the two year difference
between survey waves, it would be hard to imagine any other plausible
cause as no other large shifts in technological control existed in the
roughly two years between survey waves. Nevertheless, it is important to
keep in mind that it is only a proxy measurement. These variables
(\texttt{year} for \texttt{COVID}, \texttt{GP}, \texttt{TA}, and
\texttt{DEMO}) are entered into a structural equation model with paths
constrained to that described by the DAG in Figure~\ref{fig-dag} and
then the parameters are estimated using the \texttt{lavaan} library in
\texttt{R}.

\end{tabular}

}

\end{table}%

The results from this analysis in Table~\ref{tbl-mediationmodel} confirm
some of the previous findings and also reveal some interesting new
features of the data. As before, government performance plays an
important role in determining tracking acceptance. Similarly,
demographic questions do help predict tracking acceptance, but only by a
little bit. Demographics do not help predict views on government
performance, and therefore, it is not surprising that demographics does
not have an indirect effect on tracking acceptance through government
performance either. However, the Covid-19 experience, as operationalized
by the year variable, does 1) positively increase tracking acceptance
(direct path) 2) negatively decreases government performance evaluations
(direct path) and 3) negatively decreases tracking acceptance through
government performance evaluations (indirect path). The size of the
coefficients indicates that the sum of the effects is still positive on
tracking acceptance. These results indicate that the Covid-19 experience
in China did have the effect identified by You et al. (2024), which did
result in the hypothesized decrease in acceptance of government
tracking. However, this decrease in support was cancelled out by the
direct effect of Covid-19 on acceptance of tracking. A plausible
interpretation of this is that, as Kostka and Habich-Sobiegalla (2024)
has found, respondents agree that the tracking during Covid-19 lockdowns
was necessary, but, because of the government incompetence in responding
to the spread of the virus, they were less likely to positively agree
than they might otherwise have been.

\subsection{Comparing attitudes to private
monitoring}\label{comparing-attitudes-to-private-monitoring}

Finally, it is interesting to compare the determinants of government
tracking attitudes with those that determine attitudes toward private
tracking of personal information. To compare these two sets of
attitudes, Table~\ref{tbl-privatepublic} includes models that use the
previous acceptance of government tracking index (\texttt{Public\ TA})
as the variable alongside a similarly constructed index variable that
measures acceptance of private monitoring (\texttt{Private\ TA}).

The results here suggest that the determinants of attitudes towards
private company tracking are somewhat different than those that
determine attitudes towards public tracking. The \texttt{year} variable
is not significant for the private tracking models, while the tech savvy
coefficient has roughly doubled. Unsurprisingly, government performance
is also not related to private tracking acceptance. Finally, the
intercept is generally lower for private tracking acceptance, indicating
that respondents are less willing to accept private tracking, all things
being equal.

These results lend support to the hypothesis that acceptance of public
tracking has different determinants than those for private tracking and
also supports previous research that finds a significant difference
between acceptance of these two types of monitoring. The \texttt{year}
variable being insignificant for the private tracking indicates that the
pandemic-era tracking was not perceived as being fundamentally related
to commercial monitoring.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec-conclusion}

China's experience with Covid-19 significantly altered attitudes towards
government tracking - even though trust in the state decreased, overall
support for tracking increased. Demographic variables and informational
variables do not serve as strong predictor variables for attitudes
towards government tracking. Factors that predict government tracking
acceptance do not show a meaningful relationship with private tracking
acceptance.

These results have important implications for the current literature.
Contrary to the literature on demographic characteristics and privacy,
this study found very little predictive power in demographic variables,
either with personal variables or measures of knowledge of technology.
This finding suggests that generalized privacy attitudes have different
determinants than attitudes toward government monitoring in China, a
finding that is in line with the research of Nam and Steinfeld on
American attitudes towards privacy (Nam, 2019; Steinfeld, 2017).
Additionally, while a finding that government trust is a strong
predictor of attitudes is in accordance with much of the existing
literature, a finding that public events may play a significant role in
changing attitudes is a novel finding. (Davis and Silver, 2004)
suggested 9/11 may have created an important context that shaped whether
respondents judged the surveillance necessary and acceptable, a finding
compatible with the results here. Finally, while the determinants of
acceptance of private tracking in China need further exploration than
what is presented here, they do seem to differ substantially from that
of government tracking, suggesting .

One caveat to this research is that it only asked about generalized
acceptance of tracking. Kostka et al. (2021) is one of the few studies
to focus on specific technological applications (facial recognition
technology). More research on what specific technological modes and
aspects of privacy elicit variation in acceptance would be welcome.
Additionally, this research only focused on a crisis in which trust in
government fell but the public nevertheless accepted the general social
need for the technology. Other permutations of increased / decreased
trust in government and variation in public acceptance of the role of
technological monitoring could strengthen the findings presented here.

This study suggests that context and acceptance of the rationale for
tracking independently affect attitudes toward online privacy, a finding
governments would do well to internalize as AI and big data continue to
increase the interactions between citizens and their governments.
