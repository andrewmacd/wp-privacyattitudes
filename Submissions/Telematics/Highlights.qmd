-   Demographic factors do not seem to be related to the acceptance of government technological monitoring in China

-   Government trust positively predicts acceptance of government monitoring in China

-   The direct pathway of Covid-19 substantially increased support for government monitoring

-   None of the relevant variables for public monitoring predict acceptance of private monitoring, suggesting they have different determinants
